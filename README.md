This game is a simple rock-paper-scissors game built in order to teach myself javascript through practice. 

It is very simple and not complicated at all and that is why I chose to start the Javascript learning process with developing this game. 

The goal of developing this game was to insure that I had enough knowledge with regards to javascript fundamentals.
